[*SparkFun MicroMod Weather Carrier Board (SEN-16794)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16794)

The MicroMod Weather Carrier Board for the [SparkFun MicroMod Ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod) allows you to create your own weather station with one of a multitude of processors. The carrier board includes three sensors: the BME280 temperature, pressure and humidity sensor, the VEML6075 UV sensor and the AS3935 Lightning detector. There is also a 3-pin latch terminal to add an external [soil moisture sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13637), a pair RJ11 jacks to plug in the wind and rain sensors included with our [Weather Meter Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901) as well as a microSD card slot so you can plug in an SD card to log the weather data.
